# Battleship Program Overview

Implement a one-player version of Battleship using abstract classes and derived classes.

The game involves sinking a fleet of ships in a 10x10 ocean grid. The fleet comprises Battleship (4), Cruiser (3), Destroyer (2), and Submarine (1) ships. The computer strategically places the ships, and the player's objective is to sink them with as few shots as possible.
