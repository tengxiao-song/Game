# ♠️ Blackjack Solitaire Program Overview

Blackjack Solitaire, a one-player card game with scoring rules inspired by Blackjack. The key features and rules of the game are as follows:

- **Game Objective:**
  The player aims to strategically place cards on a grid, creating hands with values close to 21.

- **Scoring Mechanism:**
  Scoring is based on individual hands formed in rows and columns on the grid. The scoring points are assigned according to specific hand types, such as Blackjack, hands totaling 21, and hands with values ranging from 20 to 16. Busted hands (over 21) score zero points.

- **Gameplay Overview:**
  1. The game begins by shuffling a standard deck of 52 cards and dealing the first card.
  2. The player places one card at a time onto the 4x5 grid, choosing any empty space.
  3. Scoring occurs when all 16 scored spaces on the grid are filled, and at most 4 discard spots are occupied.
  4. The game displays the final score, calculated based on the values of hands in rows and columns.
  5. A message indicates the end of the game along with the total score.

This implementation provides an engaging and challenging experience for players aiming to maximize their score in Blackjack Solitaire.
